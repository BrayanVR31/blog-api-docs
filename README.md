# 📘 Blog System API – Free & Open Source

Welcome to the **Blog System API**, a fully open-source and beginner-friendly RESTful API built with **NestJS**. 

This project is ideal for:
- 💻 **Junior developers** who want to learn how to consume or build modern APIs
- 🧩 **Frontend devs** looking for a plug-and-play backend for blog platforms
- 🤝 **Contributors** who want to collaborate or explore NestJS in action

> ⚡ The project includes **modern, interactive documentation** built with **Astro** and **Starlight** – offering a smooth developer experience and clean design, similar in spirit to Swagger, but powered by static site generation.

> 💼 Part of my personal portfolio, this project demonstrates backend architecture, TypeScript practices, and technical writing. You're welcome to **use**, **fork**, or **contribute**!
